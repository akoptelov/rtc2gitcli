A tool made for migrating code from an existing https://jazz.net/products/rational-team-concert/[IBM RTC] into a Git repository.
Inspired by https://github.com/{project-full-path}[rtc2git], but written in Java and hopefully faster. It is implemented as `scm cli` plugin.


== Prerequirements
- *https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-team-concert/releases/5.0.1?p=allDownloads[SCM Tools]* from IBM. To avoid an
  account creation on jazz.net site, you could use http://bugmenot.com/[bugmenot] (see also wiki page ({rtc2gitwiki}/configure-RTC-CLI[configure RTC CLI])
- Eclipse configured with scm tools as target platform (see wiki {rtc2gitcliwiki}/configure-target-platform[configure scm tools target platform])

== Usage
- create an source RTC workspace with flow target and components as wanted -> `SOURCE_WORKSPACE`
- create an target RTC workspace with `SOURCE_WORKPSACE` as flow target -> `TARGET_WORKSPACE`
- check comments at {rtc2gitcliwiki}/configure-rtc-workspaces[configure rtc workspaces]
- open shell or cmd
- step into the target directory
- load the initial target workspace:

[source,bash]
----
scm load -r <uri> -u <username> -P <password> <TARGET_WORKSPACE>
----

Execute the actual migration:

[source,bash]
----
scm migrate-to-git -r <uri> -u <username> -P <password> -m <migration.properties> <SOURCE_WORKSPACE> <TARGET_WORKSPACE>
----

== How does it work?
1. It initalizes an empty git repository and clones it
2. In this repository, it loads `TARGET_WORKSPACE` RTC workspace
3. Every change set is accepted
4. If there is a baseline on the change set, a tag is created on git
5. The change set is committed to git


== Eclipse requirements
In order to have a common coding style across multiple versions of Eclipse import the `eclipse-rtccli-format-settings.xml` as your first
step. Then unpack a SCM Tools as downloaded into the Eclipse workspace directory. As soon you have done this step you are able to import the actual 
`rtc2git.cli.extension` project. When you got compile errors, make sure to
select `*rtc2git*` as your default Target Platform.

=== Setup Eclipse development environment
In order to enhance the the migration tool or fix a bug that you may encounter here are the steps to set up a development environment

- Configure SCMTools Target Platform described here in the {rtc2gitcliwiki}[wiki]. Point to the folder where your `scm.exe`/`lscm.bat` is
  (If you use eclipse classic aka non javaee eclipse, install the Eclipse Plugin Development Tools as described
- Clone this repo and import it in eclipse as maven project
- Open `pom.xml` and follow the hint to install the missing maven connector
- Update maven project using [ALT]+[F5]
- By this point the project shouldnt contain any errors (make sure you have still your created target platform in window preference selected)
- You should have an launch-configuration named rtc2git -> start it
- In your console window you should see _"Help for: scm migrate-to-git"_
- Open the launch-config and edit the command in arguments/program arguments
